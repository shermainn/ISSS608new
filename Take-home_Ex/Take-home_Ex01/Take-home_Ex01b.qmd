This is on the Phase ll of Take-home exercise 1 where I will be evaluating and critiquing on one of my peer's, Celin, Take-home exercise 1 from her Netlify shown [here](https://isss608celin.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01/take-home_ex01).

# 1. Overview

In this phase 2, I will be providing 3 good design principles and 3 areas for further improvements for data visualization of plots done by Celin.

# 2. Critique of Plots

## Pie Chart by Region

For the pie chart shown below, there are some good design principles such as:

-   Labeling of slices: The chart labels shown on the legend directly corresponds with the category and percentage shown.

-   Flat 2D design: This avoids the distortion of the pie chart that could happen when using a 3D plot.

-   Sorted Slices in descending order: As the slices are arranged sequentially from biggest to smallest in a clockwise direction, this helps me to quickly grasp the distribution of values.

Areas to improve on:

-   Limit the chart to one variable: The pie chart should only show one factor instead of comparing two factors as it is quite difficult to interpret visually. It would be clearer if it is focused on one factor - such as gender and use colour variations to represent the regions within that category.

-   Unclear percentage meaning: I am unable to distinguish what the total percentage actually represent - whether they are referirng to the distribution by region within the total population or by gender when I look at the chart visually. This ambiguity makes the chart pretty confusing and would need further clarification

-   Improve colour transparency: This makes the chart harder to distinguish between sections. Hence, reduce the opacity or use more contrasting colours to enhance the readability

# 3. Makeover design of the Pie Chart

## Cleaned Data

## Modified Pie Chart

```{r}

female_data <- pie_all_regions %>%
  filter(Sex == "Females") %>%
  mutate(
    label = paste0(Region, "\n", round(Population / sum(Population) * 100, 1), "%")
  )

# Plot: Two pie charts with direct labels
