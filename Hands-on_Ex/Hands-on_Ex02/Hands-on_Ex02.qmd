In this exercise, I will be learning on how to:

1.  Control the placement of annotation on a graph using functions provided in ggrepel package
2.  Create professional publication quality figures using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages
3.  Plot composite figures by combining ggplot2 graphs using patchwork package

# Getting Started

## Install and Load required libraries

Code chunk below is used to check if all 4 R packages (ggrepel, ggthemes, hrbrthemes & patchwork) are installed and loaded onto the environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, 
               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,
               tidyverse) 
```

## Import data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Graph 1
